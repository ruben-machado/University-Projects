## 📊 **3. CO2 Emissions Impact on Natural Disasters**


### 🔍 **Overview**

This project developed an interactive Natural Disaster Dashboard using Tableau to analyze the relationship between CO2 emissions and natural disaster occurrences. Focusing on the top 5 highest CO2-emitting countries, the dashboard visualizes disaster trends, fatalities, and geographic patterns over decades. It aims to provide decision-makers, emergency responders, and the public with actionable insights for disaster preparedness and climate action.

### 🛠️ **Tools & Technologies**

- **Data Visualization Software**: Tableau
- **Data Analysis**: Aggregation and visualization of disaster and CO2 emissions data
- **Visualizations**: Line graph, bubble chart, horizontal bar graph, and interactive map

### 📂 **Dataset**

The dataset was compiled from 5 Excel files, each focusing on a specific aspect of natural disasters and CO2 emissions:

- Climatological
- CO2 Emissions
- Geophysical
- Hydrological
- Meteorological

These files were integrated to provide a comprehensive view of disaster occurrences, impacts, and their correlation with CO2 emissions.

### 🚀 **Key Findings**

- Correlation between CO2 emissions and disaster frequency: Higher CO2-emitting countries generally experience more natural disasters
- Impact of population density and infrastructure: Countries like India and China, with high population densities and less developed infrastructure, suffer higher fatalities despite similar disaster frequencies
- Geographic patterns: The map visualization highlights global disaster hotspots and trends over decades, aiding in identifying high-risk regions
- Actionable insights: The dashboard emphasizes the need for climate action and improved disaster preparedness to mitigate future impacts
