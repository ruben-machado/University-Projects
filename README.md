# University Projects  

Welcome to my University Projects Repository! This repository showcases data science, business intelligence, and data visualization projects completed during my master's degree. It includes code, datasets, dashboards, and analyses, highlighting technical skills and practical applications.

## **Projects**

### ðŸ“Š **[1. Budgeting for the Future](https://github.com/ruben-machado/University-Projects/tree/main/1.%20Budgeting%20for%20the%20Future)**
This project enhances participatory budgeting in Mining City by classifying residents into lifestyle segments (e.g., Travel Enthusiast, Health-Conscious) using Python-based machine learning. Key steps included data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature engineering), feature selection, and multiclass classification models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Stacking Classifier). 

### ðŸ“Š **2. Fabridoce**

### ðŸ“Š **[3. CO2 Emissions Impact on Natrural Disasters](https://github.com/ruben-machado/University-Projects/tree/main/3.%20CO2%20Emissions%20Impact%20on%20Natural%20Disasters)**

In this project, a Dashboard was created using Tableau to analyze the correlation between CO2 emissions and natural disaster occurrences. The dashboard focuses on the top 5 highest CO2-emitting countries, visualizing disaster trends, fatalities, and geographic patterns over decades through interactive line graphs, bubble charts, bar graphs, and a global map. It highlights the link between emissions and disaster frequency. Designed for decision-makers and the public, the dashboard aims to support informed climate action and disaster preparedness.

### ðŸ“Š **[4. House Pricing Regression](https://github.com/ruben-machado/University-Projects/tree/main/4.%20House%20Pricing%20Regression)**

This project demonstrates the benefits of data-driven pricing at Cuckoo Cribs Corporation. A predictive model, built in KNIME using regression techniques, outperformed subjective pricing methods. After testing Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, and Polynomial Regression, the best-performing model was selected for deployment. Two implementation strategies were proposed, along with three practical applications for real estate agents. This approach improves pricing accuracy, operational efficiency, and investment decisions.


### ðŸ“Š **5. Hotel Cancellation Prediction**
