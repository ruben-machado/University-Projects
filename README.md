# University Projects  

Welcome to my University Projects Repository! This repository showcases data science, business intelligence, and data visualization projects completed during my master's degree. It includes code, datasets, dashboards, and analyses, highlighting technical skills and practical applications.

## **Projects**

### ðŸ“Š **[1. Budgeting for the Future](https://github.com/ruben-machado/University-Projects/tree/main/1.%20Budgeting%20for%20the%20Future)**
This project enhances participatory budgeting in Mining City by classifying residents into lifestyle segments (e.g., Travel Enthusiast, Health-Conscious) using Python-based machine learning. Key steps included data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature engineering), feature selection, and multiclass classification models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Stacking Classifier). 

### ðŸ“Š **[2. Data Warehouse & BI Dashboards](https://github.com/ruben-machado/University-Projects/tree/main/2.%20Data%20Warehouse%20%26%20BI%20Dashboards)**

This project focused on developing a structured Data Warehouse (DW) for Fabridoceâ€™s sales data using the Kimball methodology. The ETL process was implemented to consolidate diverse datasets into a Star Schema, ensuring efficient querying. Built on Microsoft Fabric, the DW was enhanced with a semantic model to simplify data interpretation. Additionally, interactive dashboards and paginated reports were developed in Fabric, Power BI, and Power BI Report Builder enabling users to explore trends and make data-driven decisions. The project improved business insights through dynamic visualizations and DAX measures.

### ðŸ“Š **[3. CO2 Emissions Impact on Natrural Disasters](https://github.com/ruben-machado/University-Projects/tree/main/3.%20CO2%20Emissions%20Impact%20on%20Natural%20Disasters)**

In this project, a Dashboard was created using Tableau to analyze the correlation between CO2 emissions and natural disaster occurrences. The dashboard focuses on the top 5 highest CO2-emitting countries, visualizing disaster trends, fatalities, and geographic patterns over decades through interactive line graphs, bubble charts, bar graphs, and a global map. It highlights the link between emissions and disaster frequency. Designed for decision-makers and the public, the dashboard aims to support informed climate action and disaster preparedness.

### ðŸ“Š **[4. House Pricing Regression](https://github.com/ruben-machado/University-Projects/tree/main/4.%20House%20Pricing%20Regression)**

This project demonstrates the benefits of data-driven pricing at Cuckoo Cribs Corporation, a real estate company. A predictive model, built in KNIME using regression techniques, outperformed subjective pricing methods. The model was designed to replace subjective pricing methods with a systematic, data-backed approach, ensuring consistency and reliability. The best-performing model was selected after testing multiple regression techniques, leading to the development of a "pricing machine" for real estate agents. Two implementation strategies were proposed, along with three practical applications for real estate agents. This approach improves pricing accuracy, operational efficiency, and investment decisions.


### ðŸ“Š **[5. Hotel Cancellation Prediction](https://github.com/ruben-machado/University-Projects/tree/main/5.%20Hotel%20Cancellation%20Prediction)**

This project applies a data-driven approach to predict hotel cancellations for the Lorem Ipsum Hotel Group. Using KNIME, machine learning models were developed to improve forecasting accuracy. The findings offer insights for decision-making and business sustainability. Regular model updates and financial impact analysis are recommended to maintain accuracy and optimize outcomes. This approach aims to balance operational efficiency with an improved guest experience.
