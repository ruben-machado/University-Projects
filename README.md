## **Projects**

### ðŸ“Š **[1. Budgeting for the Future](https://github.com/ruben-machado/University-Projects/tree/main/1.-Budgeting-for-the-Future)**
This project enhances participatory budgeting in Mining City by classifying residents into lifestyle segments (e.g., Travel Enthusiast, Health-Conscious) using Python-based machine learning. Key steps included data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature engineering), feature selection, and multiclass classification models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Stacking Classifier). 

### ðŸ“Š **2. Test**
